- 👋 Hi, I’m @deuxemm,
- my hobby approach to learning, to me, is a fantastic way to master new tools, programming languages & help reverse the effects of burnout.
- I’m always interested in improving my knowledge of technology, cloud and various coding languages, HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, Python, Golang, linux, $BASH, Ubuntu.
- 🌱 I’m currently focusing on learning Django for inspired fun & AWS as a career passion and direction.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some small but fun website projects.
- 📫 How to reach me - deuxemm@vivalidi.net
