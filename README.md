- 👋 Hi, I’m @deuxeMM,
- my hobby approach to learning, to me, is a fantastic way to master new tools, programming languages & help reverse the effects of burnout.
- I’m always interested in improving my knowledge of technology, cloud and various coding languages, HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, Python, Golang, linux, $BASH, Ubuntu.
- 🌱 Currently doing three different DevOps courses, each with it's own approach, as it supplements my career direction.
- 💞️ I’m also working through a Full-Stack WebDev course, as a passion & pass-time.
- 📫 How to reach me - deuxemm@vivalidi.net
