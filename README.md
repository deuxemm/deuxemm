- 👋 Hi, I’m @deuxeMM,
- my hobby approach to learning, to me, is a fantastic way to master new tools, programming languages & help reverse the effects of burnout.
- I’m always interested in improving my knowledge of technology stacks, cloud and various coding domains, HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, Python, Golang, Linux, $bash/zsh, Terraform.
- 🌱 Currently busy with different self-paced courses, each with it's own approach, and supplemental knowledge.
- 💞️ I’m also working through a Full-Stack WebDev course, as a passion & pass-time.
- 📫 How to reach me - deuxemm@duck.com
